Hey, I'm Saurabh Totey (pronouns are he/him/his). I find all of science and technology very fascinating, but most specifically, I am most interested by physics and computer science. I enjoy honing my piano and cello skills, and I am also a fan of videogames and TV. You can find out most of the information there is to know about me on my [portfolio website](https://www.saurabhtotey.com).
